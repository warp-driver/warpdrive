/*
  Documenting a design decisions here:

  Big question if we want this trait sync or async.
  We can implement fs backend async.
  Memory is fine sync or async (not blocking)
  EmbeddedDB backends seem to be all sync:
   - ReDB https://github.com/cberner/redb/issues/30
   - RocksDB https://docs.rs/rocksdb/latest/rocksdb/
  I could wrap ReDB in "tokio::block_in_place" to make it async friendly.
  Or just use the sync version of fs and do the async->sync conversion at a higher level

  Looking more at the wasmtime wasi engine we use and while there are some async traits available,
  It seems that there are hidden sync calls in functions we use ([like `preopened_dir`](https://docs.rs/wasmtime-wasi/26.0.0/src/wasmtime_wasi/ctx.rs.html#327-353))
  Rather than hope and just end up calling blocking calls in our async code, I would make all the engine
  stuff sync and wrap it at a higher-level, where we enter the engine (from http request or triggers).
